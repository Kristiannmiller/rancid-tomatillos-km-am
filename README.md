## About The Project
This was a pair project assigned during the first week of the third module of the Front-End Program at the Turing School of Software and Design. We achieved full functionality of the project spec with only two weeks of exposure to React.

The project reflects the functionality of familiar movie-rating applications. The application allows users to view movies fetched from an API, sign in and rate movies and leave comments on different movies of their choice.

The learning goals of this project included cementing fundamental concepts of React including architecting a React application from scratch, implementing class and functional components and utilizing React Router for path transitions and displays. Robust unit and integration testing was also implemented for each component utilizing the Jest testing suite.

## Roadmap
The total time allotted for this project was approximately two weeks. Future features contemplated by the developer include the following:

* Additional styling to the comments feature
* Feature for favoriting movies when a user is logged in
* Building an Express server from scratch (for comments and favorites)
* Deploying to Heroku
